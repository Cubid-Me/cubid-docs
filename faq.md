+ What makes CUBID different from other identity platforms? +

  CUBID offers a unique approach with its privacy-first design, Sybil attack prevention, and reusable identity stamps. Unlike traditional platforms, it focuses on user control over data, zero-knowledge proofs, and collaboration between apps.

### User Identity and Privacy

+ How do identity stamps work in CUBID? +

  Identity stamps are digital credentials that represent verified aspects of your identity. They can come from various trusted sources and help build your “human score,” making you more trustworthy to apps using CUBID.

+ What is a human score and how is it calculated? +

  The human score is a trust measure based on the number and variety of identity stamps a user collects. The more verified stamps you have, the higher your human score, which increases your credibility in the CUBID ecosystem.

+ How does CUBID protect my privacy? +

  CUBID uses zero-knowledge proofs and encryption to ensure that users only share the data they choose, while keeping other information private. It’s designed to prevent unauthorized access and give users full control over their data.

+ What personal data does CUBID collect? +

  CUBID only collects data that you choose to share, such as email, phone numbers, and identity stamps from trusted sources. You remain in control of what is shared with third-party apps.

+ Can I control what information is shared with apps? +

  Yes! CUBID allows you to selectively disclose only the information you want. You can choose which identity stamps to share with each app, ensuring that only relevant data is used.

+ What is a Sybil attack, and why should I be concerned about it? +

  A Sybil attack occurs when one user creates multiple accounts to manipulate a system. This can lead to fraud, unfair advantages in voting, gaming, or financial systems. CUBID prevents these attacks through verified identity stamps.

+ What security measures does CUBID use to protect my identity? +

  CUBID uses encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and secure APIs to protect your identity. All data interactions are encrypted, and CUBID never reveals more information than necessary to third-party apps.
